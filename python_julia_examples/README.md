In this folder, we show how to run [this Braket example](https://github.com/amazon-braket/amazon-braket-examples/blob/main/examples/analog_hamiltonian_simulation/00_Introduction_of_Analog_Hamiltonian_Simulation_with_Rydberg_Atoms.ipynb) using the tensor network simulator. We have added a section at the end of the notebook to show how to save a Braket analog Hamiltonian simulation (AHS) program into a JSON file, followed by using python subprocess to run the program with Julia-based tensor network simulator. The final result is saved in the folder `experiments/intro`.
